# basicbankingsystem
This is a responsive website made as an Intern task of The Sparks Foundation

Firstly, a Database naming 'basicbankingsystem' is created in which dummy data of 10 Users is stored in 'customers' table.

Clicking on View Customers displays list of all customers present in Database (customers table).

The Transfer option allows us to transfer amount from a user to the remaining Users present in Database.

Negative, Zero and Insufficient Balance are invalid transactions and displayed to users with an alert message.

After successfull transaction, the balance is updated in the customers table and particular transaction is appended in the 
transfers table.

The Transactions happened can be viewed via Navbar as well as from the Home Page.
